# bayesFinal

Read in fundamentals.csv and prices-split-adjusted.csv into the jupyter notebook (bayesFinal.ipynb). Then, run the Data Set-Up Section which should engineer all the features and clean the dataset. Following that, run the Model 1:LDA chunk and see the accuracies for each class (Outperformed, Underperformed, Neutral) listed at the end of the section. Finally, run the Model 2: QDA chunk and again, see the accuracies for each class (Outperformed, Underperformed, Neutral) listed at the end of the section.
